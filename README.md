Corporate Employee Welfare (CEW) – DevOps-Based Web Application
1. Project Overview
The Corporate Employee Welfare (CEW) system is a full-stack web application that centralizes employee-related functionalities such as login authentication, welfare scheme tracking, announcements, and task management. This application is developed using a modular DevOps pipeline, ensuring continuous integration, automated builds, containerization, and smooth deployment.

2. Objective
To develop a user-friendly corporate welfare application.

To integrate frontend and backend services using Docker.

To implement continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions.

To demonstrate DevOps lifecycle management through containerization and automation.

3. Technologies Used
Layer	Technology
Frontend	React.js
Backend	Flask (Python)
Database	SQLite / Postgres (as applicable)
Containerization	Docker
CI/CD	GitHub Actions
Deployment	(e.g., Heroku / Render / AWS EC2)

6. Docker Setup and Execution
To run the complete CEW application locally using Docker:

to run the docker file in code editor
docker-compose up --build
Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Backend/API: http://localhost:5000

Docker ensures portability and consistency across development and production environments.

7. CI/CD Workflow
A GitHub Actions YAML file handles:

Code checkout and setup

Linting and testing (optional)

Building Docker images

Deploying to cloud server (e.g., EC2 via SSH, or Heroku)

Sample GitHub Actions Snippet:
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build and Push
        run: docker-compose build
8. Key Features
